# The Little Herb Garden

A small website for day 1 of **Frontend Development**.

It is fixed by @pepe Josef Pospisil

## What you need

- a GitHub account
- Git
- an editor
- a browser (Firefox recommended)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (the LTS version), which brings `npx`

## Get your copy

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork**, not this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/culs-frontend-day1.git
   cd culs-frontend-day1
   ```

## Run it

Start a small web server in the project folder:

```sh
npx serve
```

The first time, `npx` asks whether to install `serve`. Answer `y`.

Then open the address it prints, usually <http://localhost:3000>.
Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.

Do not open `index.html` by double-clicking it. A `file://` page is not the Web.

## Your mission

Something is wrong. Several things, in fact.

1. Inspect before you change anything: the page, the Console, the Network panel, the Inspector.
2. Pick one problem and find out why it happens.
3. Fix it, reload, verify.
4. Commit that one fix, with a message that says what you fixed.
5. Repeat.

You are done when:

- the Console shows no unexplained errors
- the Network panel shows no missing files
- every link on the page goes where it says
- `git status` is clean, and `git push` has sent your commits to GitHub

## The project

```text
index.html    the page
style.css     how it looks
app.js        what it does
data/         the herbs, as JSON
images/       the logo and a picture
```
